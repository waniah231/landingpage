# Landing Page

![Landing Page Challenge Preview](./design/desktop-design.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. 
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

1. Make sure your local project is initialized as a Git repository and commit your changes:
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Your Desired Message"
```
2. Link your local repository to the GitHub repository:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```
3. Push your code to GitHub:
```
git push -u origin master
```


## Configure `GitHub Pages`
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. In the "Source" dropdown, select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (typically "master" or "main").
5. The page will automatically refresh, and you'll see a message indicating that your site is ready to be published.

## Access Your Deployed Site
After GitHub Pages has processed your changes, your site will be live. You can access it at the following URL:
```
https://your-username.github.io/your-repository/
```


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
